# Changelog

## 0.8.0

- **Coach picks questions with an Elo ability model**, chosen by an out-of-sample study of seven learner models ([research/REPORT.md](research/REPORT.md)). Existing progress is migrated from answer history.
- **Research:** the learner-model study, plus independent Python verification of every interview answer, cross-checked against the app in CI.
- **Security:** imported progress files are schema-validated and sanitised; Content Security Policy; scripts load with `defer`.
- **Accessibility:** colours pass WCAG AA contrast in light and dark modes; axe checks in CI.
- **Quality:** the app is split into view modules; ESLint, Playwright end-to-end tests (desktop and phone, including offline), and Lighthouse CI.
- **Demo profile** (`?demo`) for exploring the coach without practising first.
- Play Store signing pipeline, privacy page, optional cookie-free analytics, MIT licence.
